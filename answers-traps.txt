1. a0->a7   a2 holds
2. in the addr 0x26,the call to g is inlined by compiler
3. 0x7e0
4. 0x4501(since jalr will put PC+4-->ra(by default))
5. He110 World
   because in little endian, the RMB is lower address, and in ASCII table, we could find 72 refers to char 'r', so 'r' is printed first.
   if in big endian, i should be 0x726c6400, 57616 needs not to be changed.
6. It depends on $a2(not determinated)
